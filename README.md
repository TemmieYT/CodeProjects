# CodeProjects
These are some of my programming projects I make for fun! Nothing serious, just some fun stuff to do on the weekends lol.
These projects are made either for testing or fun! Do not take offense from some of my bots who are programmed to be offensive lol.
Anyway, enjoy these projects! By the way updates for these projects(i.e. new version) will be uploaded if the project is updated.

Current Projects added:
- JARVIS (Ver 1.0 Stable) + JARVIS Functions (Unstable). Please take note that without the functions JARVIS is an empty bot. Functions are required for proper 
for functioning although the functions on its own throws an Error and thus it is unstable on it's own(Not recommended to run).

- Minimax[Tic Tac Toe AI] (Ver 1.0 Semi-Stable)

- Face Detection and Photoclicking AI (Ver 1.0 Semi-Stable)
